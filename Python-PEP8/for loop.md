# Python **for** loop notes

## **else** statement with the loop

You can use an **else** statement at the end of a **for** loop for executing
some logic after the loop reaches the its final iteration.

**Example:**
```python
for number in range(5):
    print(number)
else:
    # This logic will be excuted if the loop is completed
```
