# ES6 Modules

Importing an ES6 module in any way will use a immutable binding. Meaning that all the imports 
of the refered module are going to use a reference to the same value.

> CommonJS modules export values, while ES6 modules export immutable bindings.
This blog post explains what that means.

### But and  CommonJS exports/imports?
CommonJS modules in the other hand exports a value.
