# Transport protocols

## Types of protocols
There are two, **connectionless** and **connection-oriented**

### Connectionless protocols
Used in [packet switching]() networks. In this connection all the [datagrams](https://github.com/cloudUser98/personal-notes/blob/develop/glossary.md#datagram) 
are treated as independent from one another. Each datagram must contain all the 
information required for its delivery.

**list of connectionless protocols:**
- ICMP
- IP
- IPX
- UDP
- TIPC

### Connection-oriented protocols
This type of connection requires an established connection between hosts before 
the communication can take place. The connection can be broken in three phases:

1. Connection start
2. Transfer data
1. Connection End

**list of connection-oriented protocols:**
- TCP
- IP
- IPX
- UDP
- TIPC
